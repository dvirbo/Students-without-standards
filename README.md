## About

A standard student has two basic problems:
lack of time and lack of cash.
The platform is designed to enable the student on these two levels, and the student will be able to receive (and donate) products at no cost, and also Save transportation and search time.

We hope that this project will make it easier for the students and bring them to better academic performance
